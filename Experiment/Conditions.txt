Number	Stimuli	Procedure	Condition Description	Condition Notes
1	Stimuli/LearningStimFiles.txt	Procedure/LearningProcedureFiles.txt	How to use Collector	Walks through the basics files controlling Collector
2	Stimuli/WordPairHigh.txt	Procedure/studyNoShuffle.txt	All study; The most simple case	Most simple example of using Collector to show stimuli in predefined order
3	Stimuli/WordPairHigh.txt	Procedure/studyTestNoShuffle.txt	Study and test trials	Showing how `Trial Type` influences presentation of the stimuli
4	Stimuli/WordPairHighShuffle.txt	Procedure/studyTestNoShuffle.txt	Shuffle `Stimuli` file only	"Notice how shuffling stimuli will randomize which 'Item' corresponds to a particular stimuli but the shuffling only happens once so if I call [2,3,4] as `Study` then [2,3,4] as `Test` I will see the same ordering of stimuli [2,3,4] twice in a row"
5	Stimuli/WordPairHigh.txt	Procedure/studyTestBlockShuffle.txt	Shuffle `Procedure` file only	"By shuffling procedure [2,3,4] for `Study` and `Test` independently I ensure there are 3 items studied followed by testing each of the 3 items.  The order of the items shown during study and test are independently shuffled without any constraints"
6	Stimuli/WordPairMixed.txt	Procedure/studyTestHiLo.txt	Using `Shuffle` column to give stimuli structure	"When stimuli are shuffled by type (i.e., high and low associates) I can ""sample"" from each pool.  Thinking of shuffling in this way will be useful for many different experimental applications."
7	Stimuli/WordPairMixed.txt	Procedure/studyTestHiLo-Shuffle.txt	Shuffling applied to Stimuli and Procedure files	Combining structured Stimuli shuffle + Procedure shuffle I've created a condition in which I study 1 high associate 3 times and 1 low associate 3 times.  Followng the randomized study phase I test each of the 2 studied items.  Choice of specific high and low associate items is randomly assigned for each participant and the ordering of items within the study and test phase are also randomized per participant.
8	Stimuli/WordPairMixed.txt	Procedure/Timings.txt	Showing options for `Timing` and `MinTime`	"Timing is very flexible and the `Timing` column can be `User`, `Computer`, or set to the specific number of seconds desired for the trial.  `MinTime` sets the minimum number of seconds before a trial can be submitted.  When `MinTime` is set for a trial that is `Computer` or specific # then the computer timing is treated as a maximum time."
9	Stimuli/FullStim.txt	Procedure/Demo.txt	Demo that shows off all the trial types	Putting all of the pieces together to build something more complex
10	Stimuli/FullStim.txt	Procedure/TestMC.txt	Example of multiple choice test	3 test MC trials in a row
11	Stimuli/FullStim.txt	Procedure/All Trials.txt	Examples of all presentations	user controlled so I can edit css
12	Stimuli/TestStimShuffle.txt	Procedure/TestOrderShuffle.txt	Look at Stimuli File for example of second-order shuffle (advanced feature)	This trial is an example of how second order shuffling works.  Look at the Stimuli file and run the experiment to see the output.

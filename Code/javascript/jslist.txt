Since we absoulutely need JS (because of the timer), we should be using a
SINGLE file that can be cached on the first visit. This will reduce load times
because the user doesn't have to download any new scripts, just use those that
were already downloaded.

	Since we are doing this, add a loading screen to the first page while JS
	is being loaded the first time

	Also see if we can change the server's Expires/ExpiresDefault to a far
	futures expire
	(see http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#expires)


To Do:
	Trial
		disable enter key for computer timed
			submit form
		show precache
		change multiple choice button colors
		prevent backspace from navigating back
	Other pages
		submit form after #waiting (login)

	Shared
		Timer
			RT
			RTkey
			RTlast

			minTime
			countdown

		focus on first textbox
		collapse readable() outputs
		slider for likert (and JOL?)

New episodes continue to air on FX, with reruns playing on Comedy Central, general broadcast syndication, and WGN America—the first-ever cable-to-cable syndication deal for a sitcom.[1] The show was created, developed, and produced by Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton and Charlie Day, who also star in the show. The series follows the exploits of "The Gang," a group of self-centered friends who run Paddy's Pub, a relatively unsuccessful Irish bar in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p> <br />  <br /> <p>The series follows "The Gang", a group of five depraved underachievers: twins Dennis Reynolds and Deandra "Dee" Reynolds; their friends Charlie Kelly and Ronald "Mac" McDonald; and Frank Reynolds, Dennis and Dee's father (although not biologically, it is revealed). They run the dilapidated Paddy's Pub, a bar in South Philadelphia. They are often dishonest, egotistical, selfish, greedy, unethical, lazy, manipulative, deceitful, hypocritical, self-centered, vain, disloyal, unremorseful, overly competitive, immature, vengeful, and arrogant. Episodes usually find them hatching elaborate schemes, conspiring against one another and others for personal gain, vengeance, or simply for the entertainment of watching one another's downfall. They inflict physical and psychological pain. They regularly use blackmail to manipulate one another and others outside of the group.</p> <br />  <br /> <p>Their unity is not solid; any of them would quickly dump the others for quick profit or personal gain regardless of the consequences. Almost everything they do results in competition among themselves and a considerable amount of the show's dialogue revolves around the characters arguing or yelling over one another. Despite their lack of worldly success, the Gang generally maintain high opinions of themselves and display an often obsessive interest in their own reputations and public images. Despite this high sense of self-worth, the Gang often have little sense of shame when attempting to get what they want and will often engage in activities which others would find humiliating, disgusting, or even preposterous, such as smoking crack cocaine in order to qualify for welfare, seducing a priest, or hiding naked inside a leather couch in order to spy on someone.</p>	N/A	N/A	bananna	great show	11	Passage	No	User	new trials	OFF			16380
